# COVID-19 Global Public Health Intervention Database Data Entry Manual

## Background 
As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, massive government efforts are being made globally to try to reduce morbidity and mortality. Governments have taken a large range of actions, from broad-scale social distancing such as the complete forced lockdown of cities, to light recommendations to improve hand hygiene. Moreover, governments have implemented these measures at different points in time during the course of their epidemic.

Major actions come with huge economic risks and many are asking if some of the most drastic actions are worth it. In order to start to understand how different actions may have influenced transmission across the globe, we aim to compile a living database of when, where and what policy interventions have been enacted over the course of this epidemic and how long they endure. The goal of this project is to bring together information that could be used to assess how the scope, type, and duration of public health policy interventions (those specifically aimed at reducing transmission) impact epidemic trajectories across countries and first-level administrative units across the globe. These data will be made openly available once an initial round of data collection is complete and will be updated regularly through the course of the epidemic. 

## General Overview

We will ask trusted contributors to provide data from reputable sources (typically government documents) on when specific policy changes occurred, specific groups the policy applies to and the degree to which these policies are recommended or required. Contributors will be tasked with providing updates on specific locations (countries or sub-national administrative units like provinces or states), matched to her/his language skills and interest, on a regular basis (e.g., every 2-3 days) including the original source documentation. At the start of this exercise contributors will be asked to do a review of the policy history since 1-Jan-2020 in each country entering key data through a series of online surveys. 

_Step 1: Historical Review_: Contributors to conduct a historical review of interventions to construct a timeline of policy changes since 1-Jan-2020. 

_Step 2: Historical Data Entry_: Contributors will enter data on the policy timeline through entering a series of surveys starting by entering the current policy state for each administrative unit. 

_Step 3: Regular Data Entry_: Contributors will be asked to track policy changes in their assigned areas with updates (even those documenting no change in policy) at least once per week.
